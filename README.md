Choose which street view year to show on your playable map.

#### *So far this works with the beta version of the new map maker that is supposed to replace the old map maker on October 12, 2022.

#### Workflow: Open the map maker -> choose a location -> choose a year -> save the location (click "Update Location") -> select that location and year (!important) again -> then click "Save and Reload" -> eventually click "Save and Publish" when done with map.

On the map maker page, the street view coverage will show the default coverage year (usually the most recent) instead of the year you choose previously, which can be confusing, but the coverage year you choose should (if everything worked) show up on the finished map. So if you suspect that it didn't work, make sure to test on the finished playable map...if you can.

[Click here to install](https://github.com/echandler/PanoID-for-Geoguessr-map-maker/raw/main/betterGeoGuessrMapMaker.user.js). If this doesn't work, open a new file in Tampermonkey and copy and paste the user.js script above into it.

If you plan to make a map with many locations, try https://map-making.app/ which has many more additional features that make map making a lot easier.
